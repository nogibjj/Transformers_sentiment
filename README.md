Official Pytorch implementation of the ISMIR 2022 paper "Generating music with sentiment using Transformer GANs".

We developed an adversarially trained Transformer capable of generating symbolic musical excerpts thar relate to one of the four quadrants of the arousal-valence model of human emotions.

## Model
